Hello, I am Dinkelbrotstick, the creator of this little project.

The plan is simple:
Get to know Github & start a new project (which could be the start to something bigger)

How can I do this?
  Create my first very own running website
  Adjust it with the necessary links/info
  Start building out your own ideas from here!

What should the website include:
  * basic info about myself
  * cv - work experience, ...
  * links to businesses (eg. plan on building my own "side hustle")
  * future plans

This is the plan for now - 21.10.2024
LetÂ´s go to work! :)
